Setting the Scene**\n\nDrug abuse is associated with significant negative health, financial and social consequences. Yet, illicit drug consumption remains highly prevalent and continues to be a growing problem worldwide. In 2021, 1 in 17 people aged 15–64 in the world had used a drug in the past 12 months. Notwithstanding population growth, the estimated number of drug users grew from 240 million in 2011 to 296 million in 2021.\n\nThe geopolitics of Thailand which is near the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)) of Indochina, the largest drug production site in Asia, and the constant transportation infrastructure development made Thailand became market and transit routes for drug trafficking to the third countries.\n\nIn Thailand, drug abuse is one of the major social issue. There are about 2.7 million youths using drugs in Thailand. Among youths aged between 15 and 19 years, there are about 300,000 who have needs for drug treatment. Most of Thai youths involved with drugs are vocational-school students, which nearly doubles in number compared to secondary-school students.\n\nFigure below shows geographic distribution of drug use cases by province and by year.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1584006491.png)\n\n## **1.1 Objectives**\n\nAs a curious geospatial analytics green horn, you are interested to discover:\n\n-   if the key indicators of drug abuse of Thailand are independent from space.\n\n-   If the indicators of drug abuse is indeed spatial dependent, then, you would like to detect where are the clusters and outliers, and the hotspots.\n\n-   Last but not least, you are also interested to investigate how the observation above evolve over time.\n\n## **1.2 The Task**\n\nThe specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:\n\n-   Using appropriate function of **sf** and **tidyverse**, preparing the following geospatial data layer:\n\n    -   a study area layer in sf polygon features. It must be at [province level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand) (including Bangkok) of Thailand.\n\n    -   a drug abuse indicators layer within the study area in sf polygon features.\n\n-   Using the extracted data, perform global spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://is415-gaa-tskam.netlify.app/in-class_ex/in-class_ex05/in-class_ex05-glsa).\n\n-   Using the extracted data, perform local spatial autocorrelation analysis by using [sfdep methods](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap10.html).\n\n-   Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the analysis above.\n\n# **2. Literature Review**\n\n## **2.1 Spatial Autocorrelation**\n\nI tried to understand the concept of **spatial autocorrelation**, which is based on Tobler's First Law of Geography: \"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things\" (Tobler, 1970). Spatial autocorrelation measures how much nearby spatial data points are similar or dissimilar to each other. It helps to analyze the extent of clustering or dispersion of spatial phenomena, offering insights into whether specific regions experience higher or lower-than-expected event concentrations. For example, in this context, spatial autocorrelation can reveal whether drug offenses in Thailand are clustered in particular provinces or dispersed across the country.\n\n## **2.2 Emerging Hotspot Analysis**\n\nI tried to explore the concept of **emerging hotspot analysis**, which identifies areas with a higher concentration of events than expected in a random distribution. Initially rooted in point distribution studies, it’s particularly relevant for detecting trends and patterns over time. In the case of drug offenses in Thailand, this analysis can be used to track changes in the intensity of offenses, identify newly emerging hotspots, or monitor areas where offenses are consistently high. By identifying these hotspots, policymakers can better allocate resources to address issues in specific regions.\n\n# **3. Importing Packages**\n\nI tried to import the necessary R packages using the `pacman::p_load()` function, which is an efficient way to load multiple libraries in R. These packages include:\n\n-   **sf**: for handling spatial data\n\n-   **dplyr** and **tidyverse**: for data manipulation\n\n-   **ggplot2**: for data visualization\n\n-   **sfdep**: for spatial dependency and autocorrelation analysis\n\n-   **tmap**: for creating thematic maps\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, dplyr, readr, ggplot2, sfdep, tmap, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n# **4. Importing Datasets to R Environment**\n\nI tried to load two datasets into the R environment:\n\n1.  **Drug offenses dataset**: This contains data on drug offenses in Thailand from 2017-2022.\n\n2.  **Thai geographic dataset**: This shapefile contains the geographic boundaries of Thailand's provinces.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDrug <- read_csv(\"data/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 7392 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): types_of_drug_offenses, province_th, province_en\ndbl (2): fiscal_year, no_cases\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthai_geo = st_read(dsn = \"data/tha_adm_rtsd_itos_20210121\", layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121' from data source \n  `C:\\EasonXu-HY99\\IS415\\Take-Home_Ex\\Take-Home_Ex02\\data\\tha_adm_rtsd_itos_20210121' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 97.34336 ymin: 5.613038 xmax: 105.637 ymax: 20.46507\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo ensure the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the geographic dataset is consistent, I used the following code to inspect it:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nst_crs(thai_geo)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: WGS 84 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",\n    DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4326]]\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## **4.1 Visualizing the Map of Thailand’s Provinces**\n\nI tried to visualize the provinces of Thailand using the `tmap` package.

This suggests that, using contiguity-based methods alone, some regions were isolated, preventing them from being included in the spatial analysis.\n\n2.  **Disjoint connected subgraphs**: The presence of **disjoint subgraphs** (separate groups of connected regions) means the spatial connectivity is fragmented, further justifying the need for **KNN** to ensure that all regions have neighbors.\n\n3.  **KNN ensures connectivity**: By using **centroids** and calculating **KNN**, I ensure that every region (including isolated ones) has neighbors, maintaining the integrity of the spatial analysis. KNN allows me to connect regions even if they are not physically contiguous but spatially close based on distance.\n\n4.  **Balanced links**: KNN balances the number of links per region. In this case, the **average number of links is 4.57**, ensuring more consistent neighbor counts across regions and improving the reliability of the spatial analysis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncentroids_drug_use <- st_centroid(drug_use_cases_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nneighbors_drug_use <- st_knn(centroids_drug_use, k = 5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nI tried to compute the **spatial weights matrix** using the contiguity-based neighbors.

The observed Moran's I value is marked by the **red vertical line**. From the plot, it is clear that the observed Moran's I value (around **0.15**) is positioned to the right of the bulk of the simulated values, which center around **0**. This indicates that the observed value is significantly higher than most of the random simulations, further supporting the presence of **positive spatial autocorrelation** in the data. The shape of the histogram shows the range of possible Moran's I values under the assumption of spatial randomness, and the positioning of the observed value outside this range confirms the statistical significance of the spatial clustering observed in the previous test. This visual representation reinforces the conclusion that the spatial patterns in the data are not random but exhibit significant spatial dependence.\n\n### **7.2.2 Permutation Test for Suspects in Drug Use Cases**\n\nThe same permutation test was performed for **suspects in drug use cases**:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1234)\ngmoran_suspect <- global_moran_perm(\n  suspects_in_drug_use_cases_data$no_cases,\n  neighbors_suspect,\n  weights_suspect,\n  nsim = 999)\ngmoran_suspect\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tMonte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  x \nweights: listw  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.14953, observed rank = 987, p-value = 0.026\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe histogram of results, with the observed Moran’s I statistic marked, helps assess the significance of spatial clustering:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(gmoran_suspect$res, main=\"Histogram of Global Moran's I Monte-Carlo Simulation Results (Suspects in Drug Use Cases)\", xlab=\"Monte-Carlo Results\", ylab=\"Frequency\")\n\nabline(v = gmoran_suspect$statistic, col = \"red\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this updated **Global Moran's I Monte Carlo Simulation** result, I observed a histogram displaying the distribution of simulated Moran's I values under the assumption of spatial randomness. The **red vertical line** represents the observed Moran's I statistic, which appears around **0.15** and is noticeably positioned to the right of the majority of the simulated Moran's I values, which cluster around **0**. This demonstrates that the observed Moran's I is significantly greater than the random expectations, reinforcing the presence of **positive spatial autocorrelation** in the data. The fact that the observed value lies far outside the bulk of the Monte Carlo results supports the earlier finding that the spatial pattern in the data is not due to chance, but rather, exhibits a statistically significant spatial clustering.\n\n## **7.3 Global Geary’s C Test**\n\nI tried to perform the **Global Geary's C test**, another global measure of spatial autocorrelation.
