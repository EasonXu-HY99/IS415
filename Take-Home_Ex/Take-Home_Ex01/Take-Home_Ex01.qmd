## **Context**

Millions of lives are devastated every year by armed conflicts, as wars continue to leave communities shattered. While the 1990s and early 2000s saw a decline in global conflict, the situation has deteriorated significantly since 2012. This new wave of conflict was sparked by the Arab uprisings in 2011, leading to wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen. The instability in Libya further contributed to a prolonged crisis in the Sahel region. Subsequent major confrontations include the 2020 Azerbaijani-Armenian war over Nagorno-Karabakh and the brutal fighting in Ethiopia's Tigray region. Myanmar’s military coup in 2021 and Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine further escalated global violence. More recently, Sudan and Gaza have been devastated by conflict in 2023. As a result, more people today are being displaced, killed, and driven into humanitarian crises than at any time in recent decades.

### **Introduction**

Geospatial analytics provides powerful tools to understand and address the complex societal problems driven by armed conflict. Through spatial point pattern analysis, researchers can gain deeper insights into the distribution of conflict events and their impact over time and space. This study focuses on Myanmar, a nation that has experienced escalating violence since the 2021 military coup. By applying spatial and spatio-temporal point pattern analysis techniques, this study aims to uncover patterns in the geographical distribution of armed conflict in Myanmar between 2021 and mid-2024.

### **Objectives**

The primary objective of this analysis is to utilize geospatial methodologies to examine the spatial and temporal trends of armed conflict in Myanmar. Specifically, this study will:

-   Investigate the spatial distribution of four key types of events: **Battles**, **Explosion/Remote violence**, **Strategic developments**, and **Violence against civilians**.

-   Analyze the quarterly frequency and intensity of conflict events from January 2021 to June 2024.

-   Apply spatial and spatio-temporal point pattern techniques to identify and map hotspots and clusters of conflict activity.

### **Data**

-   **Armed Conflict Data:** The data used in this analysis is derived from the **Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)**, an internationally recognized source of data on violent conflict and protests worldwide. The dataset spans from January 2021 to June 2024, focusing on specific types of events in Myanmar.

-   **GIS Data:** The geographical boundaries for analysis are based on geospatial data from the **Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)**. The dataset includes administrative boundaries at three levels: states and regions (admin1), districts (admin2), and townships (admin3), which will be integrated with the ACLED conflict data for spatial analysis.

### **Limitation**

Several limitations are inherent in this analysis:

-   **Data Incompleteness:** Due to reporting biases, some conflict events may be underrepresented, especially in remote areas where data collection is challenging.

-   **Temporal Precision:** The temporal resolution of the data is constrained to quarterly intervals, which may limit the granularity of time-series analysis.

-   **Geospatial Accuracy:** While the data provides geographic coordinates, varying levels of precision in these coordinates may affect the accuracy of spatial analysis at the finer administrative levels.
